    <p> <mark>"Good morning,</mark> little Hans," said the Miller.'"Good morning," said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear. '"And how have you been all the winter?" said the Miller. "Well, really," cried Hans, "it is very good of you
        to ask, very good indeed. I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well." '"We often talked of you during the winter, Hans," said the Miller, "and wondered how
        you were getting on."'"That was kind of you, " said Hans; "I was half afraid you had forgotten me."'"Hans, I am surprised at you," said the Miller; "friendship never forgets. That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand
        the poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-by!"'"They are certainly very lovely," said Hans, "and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many. I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's
        daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money."'"Buy back your wheelbarrow? You don't mean to say you have sold it? What a very stupid thing to do!"'"Well, the fact is," said Hans, "that I was obliged to. You see the winter was a very bad
        time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. But I am going to buy them
        all back again now." '"Hans," said the Miller, <u>"I will give you my wheelbarrow. </u>It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. I know
        it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow
        for myself. Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow."'"Well, really, that is generous of you," said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. "I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank
        of wood in the house."'"A plank of wood" said the Miller; "why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up. How lucky you mentioned it! It is quite remarkable
        how one good action always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true friendship never notices things like that.</p>

    <p style="color:yellow">Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day."'"Certainly," cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.'"It is not a very big plank," said the Miller, looking at it, "and I am afraid that after I
        have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return. Here is the basket,
        and mind you fill it quite full." '"Quite full?" said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market, and he was very anxious to get his silver
        buttons back.'"Well, really," answered the Miller, "as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from
        selfishness of any kind."</p>


    <p> '"My dear friend, my best friend," cried little Hans, "you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden. I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day;" and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's
        basket. '"Good-bye, little Hans," said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand. '"Good-bye," said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.'The
        next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road. So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.<del>'There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.
         '"Dear little Hans," said the Miller, "would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?"'"Oh, I am so sorry," 
         said Hans,"but I am really very busy to-day. I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll."
       '"Well, really," said the Miller, "I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse."</del></p>
