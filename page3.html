    <p>«Upon my word,» said the Miller, «you are very lazy. Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don 't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish. You
        must riot mind my speaking quite plainly to you.
        <sup> course I should not dream of doing so if I were riot your friend. But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter,</sup> but a true friend always
        says unpleasant things, and does riot mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.» «I am very sorry,» said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap,
        <sub>«but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.</sub> Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?» «Well, I am glad of that said the Miller, clapping little
        Hans on the back, for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.»

        <marquee direction="left;">«Poor little Hans was very anxious

        </marquee> to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.« Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?», he inquired
        in a shy and timid voice. «Well, really,» answered the Miller, «I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.»
